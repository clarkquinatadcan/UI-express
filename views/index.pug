					h1 About 
						span NepaBlast
					p The market is rife with subpar powdery mildew treatment products that pose new threats to human health and safety and cause topsoil depletion, air pollution, groundwater contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions.
					p We believe that long-term stewardship of both natural and human resources is of equal importance to short-term economic gain. For us, the health and safety of the environment and its inhabitants come first. It is this steadfast commitment to maximizing crop and plant production without compromising environmental and consumer wellbeing that gave us the drive to create NepaBlast.
					p NepaBlast is a superior water-based, non-toxic, all-natural, contact-based disinfecting solution that uses proprietary Nanomolecular Electronic Polarity Alignment (NEPA) to effectively destroy powdery mildew by balancing out natural botanical pathways to synergize the plantâ€™s ability to fight infection and resist its recurrence.
					p NepaBlast also works on all other plant diseases and pests, including spores, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi, yeast, and algae. This powerful oxidizing and disinfecting agent is perfectly safe and can easily be applied multiple times per day without causing harm to the plant, environment, or consumer.
					p Get rid of stubborn powdery mildew upon contact and yield healthier, happier plants without the need for harmful chemicals with NepaBlast.
